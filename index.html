                <p>Atomic Habits by James Clear:                      
                    the life-changing million-copy
                    He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two
                    push-ups a day,
                    waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.
                    These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your
                    life.
                    In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such
                    life-altering outcomes.
                    He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected
                    power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone),</p>

                    Amoral, cunning, ruthless, and instructive, this piercing work distils three thousand years of the

                    synthesizing the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun-tzu, Carl von Clausewitz, and other great

                <p>The Psychology of Money By Morgan Housel: Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you
                    know.
                    It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach,
                    even to really smart people. Money investing, personal finance,
                    and business decisions is typically taught as a math-based field,
                    where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do.But in the real world people don't make financial
                    decisions on a spreadsheet.
                    They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique
                    view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. .</p>
